### Questions every front-end develepor needs answered before beginning a new project.

(!) **Note**: Sometimes, one or more of these questions cannot be answered at the conception of a new project. Perhaps the client does not know, and it might be our job to help them figure it out.

It's okay when this happens, but it should be acknowledged. Furthermore, the current status of a question should be written down and updated as new information is available. It is important that the answers to these questions be continually saught after, not just by developers but by everone involved.

## What is it?
This is an obvious one, but it's easier said than done. Describe the project, it's goals, any research that has been done, and any other information about what the project is.

## Who else is working on it?
Usually projects are a team effort. It's important to know who you are working with so that you can open a line of communication with other team members as soon as possible. You should know who you are working with, how to contact them, their strengths and weaknesses, and what they are working on / responsible for.

Assessing the team at hand will help you do your job better. You can prevent work from being duplicated. You know who to go to for help and based on your team's strengths and weaknesses, how you can best add value.

## Has any work been done so far?
Entering a project midway through it's production is very different than starting fresh. If front end development has already started, chances are a lot of decisions have already been made about things like stack and architecture. You will have to get up to speed with the curent state of the project before beginning any serious development.

Conversely, if the project has not yet started, you may have a chance to influence some of these decisions.

## Are there any technology / stack restrictions?
If it's not okay to use JavaScript, you better learn that now, as opposed to later. Can you use a front-end framework? Does it matter which one? How bout a CSS preprocessor? Are you free to use your favorite, or are you required to use something specific?

Stack decisions directly influence a front-end devleoper's day to day life. Not being able to use a CSS preprocessor for example, would make the styling process much more difficult, slower, and harder to maintain. Sometimes however, there are good (or not so good) reasons for such restrictions. Point being, always explain WHY such a restriction (or lack of) is in place.

## What are the minimum device requirements?
It is important to know in advance what the minimum device requirements are for any project. Not only might this influence stack or technology decisions, but also UX (ex: you can't hover on an iPad), as well as project preparation. Do you need to hunt down testing devices? Install certain operating systems?

## What are the minimum browser requirements?
Browsers are a beast of their own, and can dictate the logic used in both style and function. It is important to know this right away, as retro fitting or debugging is a time consuming nightmare.

## What are the required screen sizes?
Should the site be responsive? If so, at what sizes? Or should it be fluid, and look good at any size? Where can the responsive design files be found?
